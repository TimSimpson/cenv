# Changelog

This changelog is losely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Cenv adheres to [Semi-Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). That means it adheres to Semantic Versioning, except when I screw something up. That said, [Semantic Versioning is mostly a pit of lies anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISy7EJQPzI) so hopefully you won't judge me too much.
